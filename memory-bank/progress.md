## Next Steps

### Potential Next Sprints
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User registration
   - Login functionality
   - Password reset
   - Session management

2. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Web application (Next.js)
   - Core engine structure
   - Platform-specific modules

3. **Cloud Database Design**
   - User profiles
   - Context storage
   - Preferences
   - Usage analytics

### Questions for User Direction
Before proceeding, we need the user's input on:
1. Which of the potential sprints should we implement next?
2. What specific aspects should we focus on within that sprint?
3. What implementation approach would you prefer?
4. Are there any specific components you'd like us to implement or exclude?

## Development Workflow
Our structured workflow ensures clear communication and efficient progress:

1. **User as Project Director**
   - The user has final decision-making authority
   - The user determines when a sprint is complete
   - The user selects which sprint to work on next
   - All significant decisions require user approval

2. **Question-Based Collaboration**
   - Detailed questions asked before starting work
   - Clarification sought on implementation details
   - Options presented with pros/cons for user selection
   - Regular progress updates provided

3. **Collaboration Framework**
   - Working together as partners
   - Avoiding assumptions about requirements
   - Seeking validation at key development points
   - Maintaining documentation alongside code

4. **Git Workflow**
   - Working in feature branches
   - Master branch contains only validated code
   - Permission requested before Git operations
   - Feature branches closed after merging

5. **Sprint-Based Development**
   - Current sprint: Awaiting user direction
   - Potential next sprint: Authentication Flow (pending user approval)
   - Future sprints: To be determined based on user priorities

## Known Issues
No issues at this time as we're in the initial setup phase.

## Implementation Timeline
The implementation timeline will be established after the user selects the next sprint and provides direction on priorities.

## Development Workflow

### User as Project Director
- The user is the project director with final decision-making authority
- Only the user determines when a sprint is complete
- The user selects which sprint to work on next
- Provide detailed reports on changes and implementation plans
- Present multiple implementation options with clear justifications
- Seek explicit approval for all significant decisions

### Question-Based Collaboration
- Before starting any work, ask detailed questions such as:
  - "Would you like to implement this feature in this sprint?"
  - "Can I add this component? It seems appropriate because..."
  - "I suggest this approach because it's more maintainable/scalable/efficient..."
- Ask for clarification on implementation details and preferences
- Present implementation options with pros/cons for user selection
- Provide detailed explanations of planned approaches before starting work
- Report all changes with clear explanations of what was done and why

### Collaboration Framework
- Always ask questions when unsure about requirements or approach
- Seek permission before taking actions that affect the development environment
- Present options and recommendations rather than making unilateral decisions
- Confirm before running development servers (user may already have them running)
- Request approval before creating new branches or making major changes
- Work together with the user as collaborative partners
- Avoid assumptions - when in doubt, ask for clarification
- Provide regular progress updates during sprint implementation

### Git Workflow
- Work is organized in feature branches
- Master branch contains only validated, working code
- Feature branches are created for each new functionality
- Branches are merged to master only after user validation
- Descriptive commit messages are used
- Always ask permission before creating branches or making significant Git operations

### Sprint-Based Development
We follow a sprint-based approach, focusing on one component/feature at a time:

**Current Sprint Status**: Awaiting user direction  
**Potential Next Sprint**: Authentication Flow (pending user approval)  
**Branch**: To be determined based on user decision  

**Completed Sprints**:
- Project Initialization (master)

- Web Authentication Flow
- Web Download Page

## Next Steps and Questions
Before proceeding with the next sprint, we need user direction:

1. Would you like to implement the authentication flow in the next sprint?
2. If not, which feature would you prefer to prioritize?
3. Can we create a feature branch for the selected work?
4. What approach would you prefer for implementing the selected feature?
5. Are there specific aspects of the feature you'd like to focus on or exclude?
