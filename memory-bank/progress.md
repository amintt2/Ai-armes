# Progress Tracker

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Work is organized in feature branches
- Master branch contains only validated, working code
- Feature branches are created for each new functionality
- Branches are merged to master only after user validation
- Descriptive commit messages are used

### Sprint-Based Development
We follow a sprint-based approach, focusing on one component/feature at a time:

**Current Sprint**: Web Authentication Flow  
**Branch**: `feature/auth-flow` (to be created)  
**Status**: Planning

**Completed Sprints**:
- Project Initialization (master)

**Planned Sprints** (in priority order):
1. Web Authentication Flow
2. Web Download Page
3. Web Pricing Page
4. Web Dashboard
5. Core Engine - Windows Text Capture
6. Core Engine - Suggestion Generation

## Active Git Branches
- **master**: Stable main branch with initial project structure

## Current Status
The project structure and foundation components have been established, and initial implementation of the web application is underway. Current progress includes:

1. Project Structure:
   - Created directory structure for all components
   - Set up memory bank documentation with detailed requirements

2. Web Application:
   - Set up Next.js with Tailwind CSS using Bun as package manager
   - Created Supabase client and context provider for authentication
   - Implemented main layout component with navigation
   - Designed landing page with feature highlights
   - Created authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)

3. Core Engine:
   - Defined interfaces for core engine components
   - Created platform abstraction layer
   - Defined cloud synchronization interface

Next sprint focuses on implementing functional authentication flow for the web application. After user validation, we will proceed to the next sprint.
