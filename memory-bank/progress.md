## Current Status
The project structure and foundation components have been established, and initial implementation of the web application is underway. Current progress includes:

1. Project Structure:
   - Created directory structure for all components
   - Set up memory bank documentation with detailed requirements

2. Web Application:
   - Set up Next.js with Tailwind CSS using Bun as package manager
   - Created Supabase client and context provider for authentication
   - Implemented main layout component with navigation
   - Designed landing page with feature highlights
   - Created authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)

3. Core Engine:
   - Defined interfaces for core engine components
   - Created platform abstraction layer
   - Defined cloud synchronization interface

Next steps involve setting up the Supabase project, implementing the dashboard for the web application, and starting work on the core autocomplete engine functionality.
