# Active Context

## Current Focus
Continuing development of the Next.js web application and preparing to implement core functionality for the autocomplete engine.

## Recent Activities
- Created base project structure for web and app components
- Set up Next.js web application with Tailwind CSS using Bun as package manager
- Implemented Supabase context provider for authentication
- Created main layout component with navigation
- Designed landing page with feature highlights
- Created authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)
- Defined core engine interfaces and data structures
- Created platform-specific module interfaces
- Defined Supabase database schema with security policies

## Active Decisions
1. **Web Application Implementation**:
   - Using Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for the frontend
   - Using Bun as the package manager for better performance
   - Implementing Supabase for authentication and backend functionality
   - Created custom UI components for consistent design

2. **Cloud Backend Integration**:
   - Defined detailed schema for Supabase database including tables for users, preferences, context data, and subscriptions
   - Implemented Row Level Security policies for data protection
   - Set up TypeScript types for database entities

3. **Cross-Platform Strategy**:
   - Established common interface for all platform-specific modules
   - Created initial skeleton for Windows implementation using Win32 API

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create additional pages for the web application:
   - Download page with platform-specific downloads
   - Pricing page with subscription options
   - Dashboard page for authenticated users

2. Implement functional authentication with Supabase:
   - Connect the UI to the Supabase context provider
   - Add server-side authentication checks
   - Implement protected routes

3. Begin implementation of core autocomplete engine functionality:
   - Basic text context capture for Windows
   - Simple suggestion generation algorithm
   - Initial cloud synchronization module

### Short-Term Objectives
1. Set up Supabase project with the defined schema
2. Implement Stripe integration for subscription management
3. Create user dashboard with context management features
4. Build a working prototype of the Windows client

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring secure authentication flow with Supabase
- Creating an intuitive user interface for context management
- Balancing performance and resource usage in the core engine
- Designing an efficient synchronization mechanism for context data
