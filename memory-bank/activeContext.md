# Active Context

## Current Focus
Continuing development of the Next.js web application and preparing to implement core functionality for the autocomplete engine.

## Development Workflow
We follow a structured development workflow:

1. **Sprint-Based Development**:
   - Work on specific features/components one at a time
   - Complete one task/sprint before moving to the next
   - Focus on delivering working functionality in each sprint

2. **Git Workflow**:
   - Always create feature branches from master for new development
   - Never work directly on the master branch
   - Commit and push changes to the feature branch
   - Only merge to master after user validation of working functionality
   - Create clear, descriptive commit messages

3. **Active Branches**:
   - **master**: Main stable branch (no direct commits)
   - No feature branches currently active

## Recent Activities
- Created base project structure for web and app components
- Set up Next.js web application with Tailwind CSS using Bun as package manager
- Implemented Supabase context provider for authentication
- Created main layout component with navigation
- Designed landing page with feature highlights
- Created authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)
- Defined core engine interfaces and data structures
- Created platform-specific module interfaces
- Defined Supabase database schema with security policies
- Set up Git repository with initial commit

## Active Decisions
1. **Web Application Implementation**:
   - Using Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for the frontend
   - Using Bun as the package manager for better performance
   - Implementing Supabase for authentication and backend functionality
   - Created custom UI components for consistent design

2. **Cloud Backend Integration**:
   - Defined detailed schema for Supabase database including tables for users, preferences, context data, and subscriptions
   - Implemented Row Level Security policies for data protection
   - Set up TypeScript types for database entities

3. **Cross-Platform Strategy**:
   - Established common interface for all platform-specific modules
   - Created initial skeleton for Windows implementation using Win32 API

## Next Steps

### Current Sprint: Web Authentication Flow
1. Create a feature branch `feature/auth-flow`
2. Implement functional authentication with Supabase:
   - Connect the UI to the Supabase context provider
   - Add server-side authentication checks
   - Implement protected routes
3. Test authentication flow
4. Request user validation
5. Merge to master only after validation

### Future Sprints
1. Web Application Download Page (after Authentication Flow is completed)
2. Web Application Pricing Page
3. Web Application Dashboard
4. Core Engine - Windows Text Capture
5. Core Engine - Suggestion Generation

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring secure authentication flow with Supabase
- Creating an intuitive user interface for context management
- Balancing performance and resource usage in the core engine
- Designing an efficient synchronization mechanism for context data
