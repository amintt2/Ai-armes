# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are in the initial setup phase of the AI-powered autocomplete project. The repository structure has been established with the following key components:

- Basic project structure with memory-bank documentation
- Initial .gitignore file optimized for a multi-platform AI project
- Git repository initialized with initial commit
- Core collaboration and development workflows defined

## Recent Development
The project repository has been initialized and the initial documentation has been set up to guide development. We've established:

1. User as the project director with final decision-making authority
2. Sprint-based development approach
3. Structured development workflow with feature branches
4. Clear communication patterns for collaboration

## Structured Development Workflow
Our development process follows these key patterns:

### Sprint-Based Development
- The user (project director) decides when a sprint is complete
- The user selects which sprint to work on next
- Implementation starts only after detailed questions and clarification
- Feature branches are created for each sprint

### Collaboration Approach
- The user is treated as the project director
- Explicit approval is required before significant work
- Detailed questions are asked before starting any sprint
- Options are presented with justifications for user selection
- Regular progress updates are provided during implementation

### Git Workflow
- Work in feature branches for all functionality
- The master branch contains only validated code
- Permission is requested before creating branches
- Merges occur only after user validation
- Feature branches are closed after merging

## Decision Context
The project is using a structured sprint-based approach, with each sprint focusing on a specific feature or component. The current status is:

- ✅ Repository initialization complete
- ✅ Project documentation structure established
- ✅ Development workflow defined
- ⏳ Awaiting user direction on first implementation sprint

## Next Steps
Based on the project structure and goals, potential next sprint tasks include:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Implement the core user authentication system using Supabase Auth
   - User registration
   - Login functionality
   - Password reset
   - Session management

2. **Project Structure Setup**: Establish the core directories and initial files for:
   - Web application (Next.js)
   - Core engine structure
   - Platform-specific modules

3. **Cloud Database Design**: Design and implement the initial Supabase database schema
   - User profiles
   - Context storage
   - Preferences
   - Usage analytics

Before proceeding with any of these tasks, we'll need to:
1. Get user approval on which task to tackle first
2. Ask detailed questions about implementation specifics
3. Present options with justifications for the approach
4. Get explicit permission to create a feature branch
5. Implement with regular progress updates
6. Seek validation before considering the sprint complete

## Development Workflow
We follow a structured development workflow:

1. **Sprint-Based Development**:
   - Work on specific features/components one at a time
   - Complete one task/sprint before moving to the next
   - Focus on delivering working functionality in each sprint
   - **The user decides when a sprint is complete**
   - **The user selects which sprint to work on next**

2. **Git Workflow**:
   - Always create feature branches from master for new development
   - Never work directly on the master branch
   - Commit and push changes to the feature branch
   - Only merge to master after user validation of working functionality
   - Create clear, descriptive commit messages

3. **Active Branches**:
   - **master**: Main stable branch (no direct commits)
   - No feature branches currently active

## Collaboration Approach
1. **User as Project Director**:
   - Treat the user as the project director with final decision-making authority
   - Present detailed reports on changes and implementation plans
   - Seek explicit approval before proceeding with any significant work
   - Avoid making assumptions about user preferences or project direction

2. **Ask Detailed Questions**:
   - Before starting any sprint, ask specific questions:
     - "Would you like to implement this feature in this sprint?"
     - "Can I add this component? It seems appropriate because..."
     - "I suggest this approach because it's more maintainable/scalable/efficient..."
   - Seek clarification on implementation details and preferences
   - Never assume requirements - confirm with the user

3. **Provide Options with Justifications**:
   - Present multiple implementation options with pros and cons
   - Explain the reasoning behind recommended approaches
   - Provide enough detail for the user to make informed decisions
   - Suggest best practices but defer to user preferences

4. **Collaborative Implementation**:
   - Present options and recommendations rather than unilateral decisions
   - Confirm before running development servers (user may already have them running)
   - Remember the user is a developer - collaborate as equals
   - Provide regular progress updates during implementation

5. **Get Explicit Validation**:
   - Ask for feedback on proposed implementations
   - Confirm design and architecture decisions
   - Request permission before creating branches or running commands
   - Check before making significant file changes
   - **Only consider a sprint complete when explicitly confirmed by the user**

## Recent Activities
- Created base project structure for web and app components
- Set up Next.js web application with Tailwind CSS using Bun as package manager
- Implemented Supabase context provider for authentication
- Created main layout component with navigation
- Designed landing page with feature highlights
- Created authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)
- Defined core engine interfaces and data structures
- Created platform-specific module interfaces
- Defined Supabase database schema with security policies
- Set up Git repository with initial commit

## Active Decisions
1. **Web Application Implementation**:
   - Using Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for the frontend
   - Using Bun as the package manager for better performance
   - Implementing Supabase for authentication and backend functionality
   - Created custom UI components for consistent design

2. **Cloud Backend Integration**:
   - Defined detailed schema for Supabase database including tables for users, preferences, context data, and subscriptions
   - Implemented Row Level Security policies for data protection
   - Set up TypeScript types for database entities

3. **Cross-Platform Strategy**:
   - Established common interface for all platform-specific modules
   - Created initial skeleton for Windows implementation using Win32 API

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring secure authentication flow with Supabase
- Creating an intuitive user interface for context management
- Balancing performance and resource usage in the core engine
- Designing an efficient synchronization mechanism for context data
