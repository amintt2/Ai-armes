# AI-Powered Autocomplete Project Intelligence

## Project Structure Patterns
- Web application code goes in the `web/` directory
- Core autocomplete engine code goes in `app/core/`
- Platform-specific implementations go in `app/platforms/{platform}/`
- Shared utilities go in `utils/`
- Project documentation goes in `memory-bank/`

## Implementation Guidelines
- The core engine should be lightweight and minimally impact system resources
- Platform-specific code should be isolated with a clear abstraction layer
- Web application should follow Next.js best practices
- All code should be thoroughly documented
- Privacy and security are top priorities

## Development Workflow
- Update memory-bank documentation when making significant changes
- Test platform-specific implementations on actual target platforms
- Follow established naming conventions across the project
- Keep the web application and client applications clearly separated
- Maintain clear interfaces between components
- Work on one feature/component at a time using sprint-based approach
- Complete each sprint before moving to the next one

## Repository Organization
- Use feature branches for new functionality
- Never work directly on the master branch
- Feature branches should have descriptive names (`feature/feature-name`)
- Only merge to master after user validation of working functionality
- Create separate PRs for web and application changes where possible
- Group related changes in sensible commits
- Update relevant documentation alongside code changes
- Use descriptive commit messages

## Git Branch Management
- Master branch contains only validated, working code
- Create a feature branch for each new functional unit
- Current sprint tasks should be in a dedicated feature branch
- Future sprint tasks should wait until current sprint is completed
- Close feature branches after merging to master

## Known Patterns
- Core engine interfaces should be platform-agnostic
- Platform-specific modules implement these interfaces
- Web application communicates with Supabase for backend functionality
- Client applications sync with Supabase for context data

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Use TypeScript for web development
- Use Rust or C++ for core engine and platform-specific code
- Follow platform-specific guidelines for native code
- Keep memory usage to a minimum in client applications
